GATHODE and CATHODE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Growth Analysis Tool for High-throughput Optical Density
Experiments (GATHODE) is a software package for analysing time series
of optical density measurements that were recorded with the help of a
plate reader. It allows to extract growth parameters such as maximal
growth rate, lag-time and growth yield.  The Chronological Life Span
is defined as the time cells can survive in a non-dividing state. The
Chronological life span Analysis Tool for High-throughput Optical
Density Experiments (CATHODE) uses multiple output files of GATHODE to
analyse this survival.
